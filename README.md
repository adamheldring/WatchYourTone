# WATCH YOUR TONE

## SYNTH & DRUM SEQUENSER BUILT IN REACT AND NODE USING THE WEB AUDIO API.

💻 A web synth with drum machine (…or really a 16-bar step sequenser) built in JavaScript. React in the front-end on top of Node and Express in the back-end talking to a MongoDB database. Exploring the Web Audio API and Tone.js. Matched with a retro design.

🥁 Press play and start clicking the squares for synth notes and circles for drums. This instrument is meant to be played with and you don't have to be a musician. Make a song and save it to the database. Or load someone elses song for inspiration!
